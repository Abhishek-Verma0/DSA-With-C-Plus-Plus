/***
 * 
 * What is Priority Queue ??
 * It is simple queue with some extra benefits like it does not perform the insertion into the queue  in the order of insertion. It performs the insertion in the order of priority. .. here when we input element we give priority of  that element .. later element are inserted into the queue  based on the priority of the element.

** we can remove the element with highest priority  from the queue only ..
** if two element have the same pririty in the queue then are served as order in the queue
**   it is not necessary that greater the value higher the priority it depend on how we want to treat it can be lowest  value highest priority or vice versa ..
